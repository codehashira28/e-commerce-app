# e-commerce-app

## Description

The e-commerce app is a backend application that uses the Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. It allows the user to create, read, update, and delete information from the database assuming they have the proper login credentials to the database. Any company can use this app to manage their database and compete with other e-commerce companies.

## Installation

Navigate to the the Insomnia API Development Platform website and use the prompts to install Insomnia.

## Usage

Run the 'nodemon' command in the terminal at the project path so that the server is listening at localhost port 3001. Once done, the user is then able to run GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to the server at the following endpoints at http://localhost:3001/api :

    /categories
